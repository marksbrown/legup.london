                <p>Writing clear (and correct!) answers to long questions can be difficult.
In this post, I'm going to highlight a few of the mistakes my students
have made in the past. Hopefully there will be something helpful for all
involved. Let's start with perhaps the most obvious point and work our way towards the truly obscure.</p>
<h2>1. Read the Question!</h2>
<p>And then read it again.
Slowly this time.
Do you understand what the question is asking for?</p>
<p>In many long questions it can be surprisingly easy to answer the wrong
thing.
Have a look at the following question from A2 Edexcel physics (paper 4R, June
2014). Try to think how you would answer. I will put my answer at the
end of this [post][1].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Particle accelerators accelerate particles to very high speeds before collisions occur.
New particles are created during the collisions.
Two particles of the same type can undergo two kinds of collision.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed target</strong>: a high speed particle hits a stationary particle.</p>
<p><strong>Colliding beams</strong>: two particles travelling at high speeds, in opposite directions, collide head-on.</p>
<p>By considering the conservation of energy and momentum, explain which type of collision is able to create a new particle with the largest mass.
[6 Marks]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So first off - let's not rush to answering the central question.
There's a lot of information here and more worryingly there's a lot of
information in your head!
So many students will often leap before looking at this point and dash off hoping to hit the points as they rattle out of their brain.</p>
<p><em>Do not do this!</em></p>
<p>In reality this question has very little to do with particle physics and
more in common with mechanics. If you had started writing the second you
saw <em>particle accelerator</em> and started listing interesting details of
linacs you would score zero!</p>
<p>So what is step one? I would always recommend highlighting or
underlining key physics terms. This can be a good way of forcing
yourself to observe what is actually there. The key words for me in this
question would be <em>fixed target</em>, <em>colliding beams</em>, <em>energy</em>,
<em>momentum</em>, <em>collision</em> and <em>largest mass</em>.</p>
<p>From these key terms we can begin to think about the points that we
would like to make.</p>
<h2>2. Explicit is better than implicit</h2>
<p>Which leads us into our second area. It is generally insufficient in an
exam to simply state a fact or property without relating it to the
system you're trying to describe. Put simply,</p>
<p><strong>don't assume the examiner can read your mind</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is a ruler an appropriate tool for measuring the length of a piece
of A4 paper?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bad answer would be simply stating that the precision of a ruler is
1 mm. Whilst it may seem obvious what the intent of the answer is -
Namely that the precision of the ruler is much smaller than the length of a piece of paper. It must be stated explictly in the question[2].</p>
<p>For the particle detector detector question above, a statement that
energy and momentum are conserved is insufficient unless we relate it to
the problem. For instance that the net momentum of colliding beams can
be zero but the net momentum of the fixed target cannot.</p>
<h2>3. Plan ahead</h2>
<p>Every question you do will have a number of marks associated with it.
This can be a useful way of trying to see how many points and how many
sentences you should be aiming to write.</p>
<p>By planning ahead, either by making notes or just thinking, we can
determine how to arrange our points in a logical fashion. Importantly we
can also use a sensible rule in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Write short sentences!</strong></p>
<p>For the particle detector question, the exam paper gives over two thirds
of an A4 page to write the answer. Personally I consider this to be
almost an intimidation tactic - "Write more, look at all this space
you're wasting!". Focus on what you want to say, not on filling the
page.</p>
<h2>4. Redundancy and Information</h2>
<p>Whilst we're on the topic of space, don't copy out or reword the
question in your answer. This often happens when running on automatic.
The examiner knows the question - they're looking for answers!</p>
<p>In the same vein, questions rarely have single parts. Information given
in a part of the question may be important in another. Diagrams
especially can be vital.</p>
<h2>5. Leave Space</h2>
<p>Nobody expects you to be perfect. If you can't make enough points simply
move on. Perhaps leave yourself some notes and come back at the end of
the exam.</p>
<p>If you fill up the space immediately with a scatter gun approach you
lose in two ways. Firstly you're making the examiner's job harder. They
want to give you marks! Secondly if you do think of some extra point or
you realise you were answering the wrong thing, you have no space to
neatly explain yourself. Disaster!</p>
<h2>6. Don't Panic!</h2>
<p>Practice, practice, practice. I would also strongly recommend reviewing
examiner's reports on the exam questions you are looking at if possible.
These list the general mistakes and performance of all students on an
exam.</p>
<p>Finally, don't panic. You're not stupid, you're not slow, you're just
stressed! Leave yourself any notes you do recall and move on. Don't get
trapped.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you're answering the question</li>
<li>Explicitly make your points.</li>
<li>Plan what you're going to say before saying it</li>
<li>Write short, clear sentences. Do feel obliged to fill the page.</li>
<li>Don't panic!</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck! Do you have any other suggestions or resources you've found
useful? Post in the comments below!</p>
<p><strong>notes</strong></p>
<p>[1] My model answer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The net momentum before collision can be zero for the colliding beams.
Therefore the net kinetic energy after the collision (<span class="math">\(E=\frac{p^2}{2m}\)</span>) can also be zero.
This is not the case for the fixed target collision.
Since energy and mass are related by <span class="math">\(E=mc^2\)</span>, the more energy we have,
the larger the mass we can produce.
Therefore the colliding beams can produce a higher mass than the fixed
target, as no energy is lost to kinetic energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[2] Calculation of the percentage uncertainty is another excellent way
of determining whether a tool is appropriate for the measurement.</p>
